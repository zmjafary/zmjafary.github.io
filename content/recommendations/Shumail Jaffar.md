Zille Muhammad is my university batchmate but was a senior of mine at YumyApps maybe because he started working early but by the the time I got there he was a senior and was the one who recommended me there. Although we worked in different department, professionally he was a delight. Everyone was a fan, including me and lastly this was the only time standups were fun, never before, never after, thank you for that and best of luck to you!
